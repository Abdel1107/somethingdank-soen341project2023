## About Project 

Our career services platform streamlines the job search process for students and employers. Students can create and update their professional profiles and apply for job postings, while employers can post opportunities and review candidate applications. With secure login credentials, the platform ensures confidential user information. Our aim is to bring job seekers and employers together in a simple and efficient manner.
