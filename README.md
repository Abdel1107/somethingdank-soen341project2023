## Technologies

- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL

The front-end and back-end will be entirely created with Django, while our knowledge of HTML, and CSS will be incorporated into the Django framework. The database will be constructed using SQL, and communication between the back-end and database will be facilitated through Django. The initial development steps will focus on creating the front-end of the website, followed by the back-end and database implementation.
